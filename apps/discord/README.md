## 👨‍🎓 Learnings

### How to use `/commands`
> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXehoXnFxPM

### How to create own `Command Handler`
> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NqG6tq-TLc

Interesting to watch but for now I'm using `wokcommands` and not building my own.

### Get `Project Address` (Public Key)
> https://medium.com/geekculture/building-an-nft-sales-bot-with-javascript-and-solana-3d7add28f995
> (**Section:** Running the Bot)

To do this, I usually just pull up the NFT on Solana Explorer and identify 
which creators are getting the majority of the royalties.
